# 100-Days-Of-Code

    This is my repository for #100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Through this challenge I'm going to be focused on:

# Competitive Programming
   I discovered CP on August 2019, however, it was until 
May - 2020 that I got really into it. I really like breaking
my head to get a solution and I love the feeling when a 
solution is accepted. And as a plus, there is a lot of 
knowledge that I can learn by doing CP.

   During this challenge, I'll be mainly focused on CP; 
improving my problem solving skills and code implementation
by solving problems in www.codeforces.com.

   IÂ´m am currently ranked as Specialist (1407) wich is not bad
but I am sure that I can do better. My goal is to reach 
Experte (starts at 1618). It's not an easy path but I will do
my best and I will try to be there by the end of the challenge.

# Full Stack Developer
   I am interested on being able to build things from scratch,
so I am going to start my path as full stack developer by learning 
the basics os web development (HTML/CSS/JS).

   As time goes and I start to get better, I will start moving to 
JS frameworks and backend technologies.
